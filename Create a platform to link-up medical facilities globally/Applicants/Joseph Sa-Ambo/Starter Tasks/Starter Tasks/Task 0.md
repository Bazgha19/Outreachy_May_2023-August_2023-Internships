## Introduction
In this UX research project, I aimed to gather information on 50 hospitals around the world and collect their information including their location, services provided, and website links. The research goal was to understand the range of medical services offered by hospitals worldwide and to identify any trends or patterns in their services and online presence. These findings will help us create a suitable platform that links medical facilities globally and make it easier for people to access the medical services they need.


## Research Goals
The research goals for this project were:
* To identify 50 active global hospitals and their locations
* To gather information on the medical services offered by these hospitals
* To determine the online presence of these hospitals by gathering website links


## Methodology
To achieve these goals, I conducted a quantitative research exercise, by performing the following tasks:

* Online search: I searched for information on hospitals worldwide using online search engines and directories and I gathered the data in an organized form using Open AI’s ChatGPT.  I used keywords such as "active global hospitals" and "top hospitals worldwide" to find relevant information.

* Data collection: I gathered data on the hospitals' locations, services provided, and website links using Open AI’s ChatGPT, while cross-checking from each hospital’s website to confirm accuracy of information. I then recorded this data in a spreadsheet table for easy organization and analysis.

* Analysis: I analyzed the data to identify patterns and trends in the medical services offered by hospitals and their online presence.

**Key Learnings**

The research findings revealed several key learnings:

* Hospitals in advanced countries, like the Mayo Clinic in the USA, tend to offer a wider range of medical services as compared to hospitals in developing countries.

* Hospitals in advanced countries, like Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, have a more significant online presence, well-designed websites and are easier to find online as compared to hospitals in developing countries like Buea Regional Hospital in Cameroon, which doesn’t have a website that could be found on the internet.

* Hospitals in Asia like Asan Medical Center in South Korea tend to specialize in specific medical services, such as plastic surgery and radiation oncology.

* Hospitals in Europe and North America tend to offer a broader range of medical services, including specialized treatments and research facilities.

* Hospitals in Africa tend to offer basic general medical services, with a few specialized areas.


**Recommendations**

Based on our research findings, I recommend the following:
* Focus on connecting hospitals in developing countries with hospitals in advanced countries to provide a broader range of medical services to patients in developing countries.

* Develop a platform that lists medical facilities worldwide and includes relevant information such as medical services offered, location, and website links.

* Provide resources for hospitals in developing countries to improve their online presence, such as web design and search engine optimization services.

* Consider partnering with hospitals in advanced countries to provide training and support to hospitals in developing countries.


**Conclusion**

The research findings have provided valuable insights into the medical services offered by hospitals worldwide and their online presence. By creating a platform that links medical facilities globally, we can help to provide better access to medical services for people worldwide.
