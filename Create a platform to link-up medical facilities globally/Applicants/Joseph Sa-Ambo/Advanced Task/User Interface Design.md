## **Phase 3 of Advanced Task // User Interface Design**

# **Introduction**
To create an effective user interface that showcases the Minimum Viable Product, I used Figma to design a select number of screens that highlight the app's key features and functionality.

Figma's intuitive interface and collaborative features made it an ideal tool for creating a functional and visually appealing user interface. By using Figma, I was able to quickly iterate and refine the design, ensuring that it met the app's requirements and user needs.
# Primary Objectives for the Design

**_Simple, filtered search process simple and intuitive_**

The app enables patients to conveniently search for medical facilities in their area, based on their location and specific services required. It streamlines the process of booking appointments and receiving care, making it more efficient for patients. The search feature is prominently displayed on the homepage for easy access.<br> 
<br>
<br>
**_Booking Appointment_**

The app provides patients with the added convenience of booking appointments and receiving confirmation directly through the platform. This eliminates the need for traditional methods of appointment booking, making the process faster and more accessible.
<br>
<br>


**_Chat Feature_**

The app includes a messaging system that enables patients, hospital staff, and medical professionals to easily communicate with each other. This feature allows for efficient booking, referrals, and updates on patient status, as well as the retrieval of medical records. It provides a seamless platform for all parties involved to stay connected and informed.

**_Information about Hospital_**

The app presents comprehensive information about hospitals, including their services, facilities, and location, utilizing user-friendly maps for easy navigation. The information is displayed in a visually appealing manner, making it simple for users to access the details they need. This feature ensures that patients can make informed decisions about their healthcare choices with ease.

**_Key Settings including Language and Accessibility_**

The app offers patients the flexibility to search for hospitals in countries where the official language may differ from their own. To ensure ease of use, the app includes an option to change the language of the interface. Additionally, the app includes accessibility settings for visually impaired persons, ensuring that all users can access the app's features regardless of any physical limitations they may have.

# The Design Process

Before beginning the design process, I decided to create a mini-design system using the brand identity design I created. I camp up with Color Styles and Text Styles to make the Design Process easier.

The app design process then continued with hand-drawn wireframes on paper, allowing me to visualize the app's functionality and user interface. These wireframes were then refined into low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, adding more detail and functionality to the design.

The low-fidelity wireframes helped to further develop the design, providing a more detailed view of the app's navigation, user flow, and layout. User feedback was gathered from a sample of people and incorporated into the design, leading to the finalization of the low-fidelity wireframes.

With the low-fidelity wireframes finalized, the team moved on to creating high-fidelity wireframes, adding color, typography, and visual design to the interface. These wireframes gave the app a polished look and provided a clear picture of how it would look and feel.

The main screens for the app were created in Figma, allowing for the full fleshing out of the design and the creation of interactive prototypes that could be tested with users. The MVP screens designed included the splash screen, home page, hospital page, search page, and account page.
