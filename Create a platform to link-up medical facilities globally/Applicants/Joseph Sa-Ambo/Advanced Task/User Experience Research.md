## **Phase 1 of Advanced Task // Part 1: Research**

# **Introduction**

The purpose of this user research was to evaluate the usability and user satisfaction of an app that is to be designed to link healthcare facilities across the globe and improve access to healthcare. The app is specifically targeted toward healthcare professionals, patients, hospital staff, and caregivers.


# **Research Goals**

To understand the current healthcare practices and the existing problems faced by healthcare professionals, patients, hospital staff, and caregivers.

To identify the requirements and expectations of healthcare professionals, patients, hospital staff, and caregivers regarding the app.

To evaluate the usability and user satisfaction of the app among healthcare professionals, patients, hospital staff, and caregivers.

To gather feedback and suggestions.


# **Methodology**

The user research was conducted through 2 methods namely an online survey and one-on-one user interviews.

### Online Survey:

A survey was generated on Survey Planet, to collect data on the current healthcare challenges and expectations of healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers regarding the app. The survey participants included healthcare professionals, patients, and hospital staff from different regions of the world.

### One-on-One User Interviews:

To gain a deeper understanding of the challenges, healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers, were interviewed and their thoughts on the app were picked.



# **Outcomes/Insights**

The app is a needed intervention that will improve healthcare access and save lives.

Locations of each facility, Services provided by each facility, Appointment booking feature, and filtered search feature should be of high priority in the design of the MVP.


# **Conclusion**

This user research provides insights into the most preferred features for the app to better meet the needs of healthcare professionals and patients and improve access to healthcare globally.

## **Phase 1 of Advanced Task // Part 2: User Personas**


# **Introduction**
User personas are fictional characters that represent the target users of an app or product. They are created to help us understand the needs, goals, behaviours, and preferences of their users. In this case, I created user personas for our app that links medical facilities globally. The user personas include doctors, patients, and hospital administrators. Each persona has unique characteristics, needs, and pain points that will help us design an app that meets their requirements and solve their problems. By using user personas, we can create a user-centered app that provides a seamless and personalised experience.

### Occupation: Doctor
Sarah is a 35-year-old general practitioner who works in a rural hospital in Ghana. She has been practicing medicine for 10 years and is passionate about providing quality healthcare to her patients. Sarah frequently encounters cases where she needs to refer her patients to specialists, but finding the right specialist is often a challenge due to limited resources and connectivity in her area, which is peri-urban. She would be happy to have an app that can connect her with medical facilities and specialists worldwide to provide the best care for her patients.

## **Phase 1 of Advanced Task // Part 3: User Stories**


# **Introduction**

From the user personas and their needs, I tried to generate possible user stories to spell out the needed features of the application from the users’ perspective.


# **Sample User Stories**

- As a patient, I want to be able to search for hospitals nearby that offer the medical services I want.

- As a doctor, I want to be able to refer my patients to trusted hospitals and appropriate specialists nearby that can provide my patients with proper care for their specific needs.

- As a hospital administrator, I want to be able to send messages to other hospitals for easy communication in the case of a medical emergency or referral and also for effective collaboration.

- As a hospital administrator, I want to be able to register my hospital on a platform that links medical facilities globally and update my hospital’s page with all the details and information required.


# **Conclusion**


These user stories will help guide the development of the application and ensure that it meets the needs of its users.

## **Phase 1 of Advanced Task // Part 4: Competitive Audit**

# **Introduction**

To help inform our design decisions and stand out from the competition, I conducted research to find similar apps like ours and to identify how our app differs from theirs. These apps include Doximity, Health Gorilla, and Medici.

# **Findings**

### Strengths
The strengths of these apps include an excellent user interface, good privacy and security, and a wide range of hospitals and services available.

### Weaknesses
The challenges include high cost, limited communication features, a lack of formal support options, among others. 


# **Conclusion**

Based on this, our app can stand out by focusing on making the app free and accessible to use, building efficient communication features, and providing a user-friendly interface with technical team support on standby.
