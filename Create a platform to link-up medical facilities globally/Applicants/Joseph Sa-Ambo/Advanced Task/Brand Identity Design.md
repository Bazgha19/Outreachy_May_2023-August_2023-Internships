## **Phase 2 of Advanced Task // Brand Identity Design**

# **Introduction**

Creating a small-scale brand identity for the app was essential to ensure a uniform and consistent design language. This allowed me to establish a clear set of guidelines that defined the app's visual identity, typography, color scheme, and overall design aesthetic. By doing so, the app will be able to establish a unique and recognizable brand identity that will set it apart from other similar apps in the market. The brand identity will also help in establishing a strong connection with the target audience, as it will convey the app's values and messaging in a clear and concise manner.

# **Name of the App**
After extensive research and brainstorming, I came up with the name MedLink+ as it perfectly captured the essence and purpose of the app. The name was carefully chosen to ensure that it not only sounded appealing but also represented the app's core function of connecting medical professionals with patients. The "+" sign was added to the name to represent the additional features and benefits that the app provided to its users, such as easy access to medical resources, telemedicine services, and more.

# **Color Scheme**
After considering various color options, I chose to use a combination of cool colors, including blue (#216AF9) and red (#FD5A48), for the app's design. These colors were chosen for specific reasons that align with the app's purpose and brand identity.

Blue is known to symbolize calmness, serenity, and trust. By using blue as a primary color for the app's design, it can create a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere for users, promoting a sense of tranquility while using the app.

In contrast, red is often associated with energy, passion, and urgency. By incorporating red into the app's design, it can help users feel motivated and focused on achieving their goals, particularly if the app is designed to help users with productivity, fitness, or other active pursuits.

Additionally, both blue and red colors have been shown to evoke feelings of wellness, making them a perfect choice for an app that aims to promote overall health and wellbeing. These colors can also help to create a strong visual identity for the app, making it easily recognizable and memorable for users.

Overall, the combination of blue and red colors with hex codes #0000FF and #FF0000 respectively was chosen to align with the app's mission of promoting calmness, serenity, wellness, energy, passion, and motivation.

# **Typeface**
For optimal readability across various platforms, I have chosen the Satoshi typeface, a modern and clean sans-serif font. This typeface was selected specifically for its legibility and versatility, as it comes with a range of font sizes and styles that can be used across multiple mediums and devices.

Satoshi's minimalistic and straightforward design ensures that text remains easy to read, even at small sizes, making it ideal for use on screens with limited space, such as mobile devices or wearables. Its various font weights and styles, including regular, bold, and italic, allow for different emphasis and hierarchy of text.

Additionally, Satoshi's neutral and timeless aesthetic make it suitable for a broad range of applications, from website copy and user interfaces to marketing materials and branding. The typeface's adaptability ensures consistency and cohesion throughout the app's design, enhancing its overall visual appeal and user experience.

To add visual interest and enhance the app's overall aesthetic, I have incorporated illustrations from Storyset.com into the design. Storyset offers a diverse range of high-quality illustrations that are customizable and easy to use, making them an ideal choice for the app's design.

By using illustrations from Storyset, the app's design can visually communicate key concepts and ideas in a more engaging and memorable way, promoting user engagement and retention. Additionally, Storyset's illustrations are available in a range of styles and themes, allowing for customization to match the app's brand identity and purpose.

Moreover, the use of illustrations can help to create a cohesive visual language throughout the app, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the app's content. Overall, Storyset's illustrations offer a valuable addition to the app's design, enhancing its visual appeal and user experience.
