# Link-up Hospital Application - App Development(Flutter)

## Task Objective

Propose an application for the hospital taking into consideration the MVP. The objective of this task is to test your design skills alongside flutter mobile development.
3 to 4 screens is enough.

## My Solution

I built a 8-screen page with flutter, which I designed using figma(**kindly check design.md**). I made sure all functionalities on the page are working fine.

- Authentication:
  I used firebase for the user authentication.
- List of Hopitals:
  I basically made use of the data-collection tool I created for task 1. I made an API call on the backend of the data collection tool. [https://daniel2345.pythonanywhere.com/api/hospital/all/](https://daniel2345.pythonanywhere.com/api/hospital/all/) was the url I used to get the list of all hospitals in the database. Since it's an MVP, I got data from Task 0(make a list of 50 hospitals globally), and filled them in the data collection tool. This provided me data to test with when building my flutter app.

I would really appreciate your feedback
### Side Note
_This is my first time of creating mobile application with flutter. I tried to cover a lot within this short period, I hope to learn more and apply what i have learnt in building the proposed platform._
Thank you üôè
