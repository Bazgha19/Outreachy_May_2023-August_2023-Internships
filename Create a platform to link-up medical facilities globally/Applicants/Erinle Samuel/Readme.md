## Folder Structure
- A brief introduction about me can be found in the __introduction.md__
- In the __Starter Tasks__ folder, there are two files. The first, __Task0.md__ contains the solution to the first task. While the second one, __Task1.md__ contains the data collection tool I created for the proposed platform.
- The second folder,__Advance Task__ contains two files. The first file, __AppDev.md__ contains information about the development of the MVP, while __Design.md__ contains important information about the UI/UX of the proposed app. I decided to separate the design from development, in order to improve readability.
