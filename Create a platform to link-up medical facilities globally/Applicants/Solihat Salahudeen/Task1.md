**Research**

I researched on a tool I can use for collecting data where I come accross using forms like jotforms, google forms, Microsoft forms etc. and I even wanted to use a nocode tool (flutterflow) that I am currently learning.
I encountered some issues concerning data storage while using the nocode tool which is why I switched to google forms since this is time-limited and I can access the data collected on google formd

**Data Collected**

I focused on collecting necessary information so as not to make the form unnecessary long, the data collected are; 
1. Hospital Name 
2. Hospital Contact (phone/email)
3. Hospital Address (location)
4. Do you accept international patient
5. Hospital Type
6. Hospital Size
7. Services Offered
8. Facilities Available
9. Accreditation(s)
10. Upload Certificate(s) (if any)
