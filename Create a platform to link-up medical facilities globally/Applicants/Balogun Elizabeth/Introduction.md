# INTRODUCTION

My name is Balogun Elizabeth. I am  graduate of the department of Biochemistry, University of Lagos. I transitioned into tech considering the epileptic situation of the economy which made me unemployed and partially self employed (car dealing) and along the line, I discovered I love solving problems through critical thinking and designs. Product design did it for me. 

As a self taught product designer, while undergoing other virtual training, I needed to put my skills out to the world and challenge myself to solve complex issues. Then I came across Outreachy Internship and Mboalab contribution task. It was the perfect learning ground to merge what I learnt within the four walls of school and also outside it, while having fun doing it. 

Asides Product designing, I interned with a public general hospital where I was assigned to run the sample (sputum) of TB patients and attend to their medical needs. I am also a volunteer for an NGO that gives out to the needy and orphans, financially, medically, and the likes. 

Other skills include; Drawing.
