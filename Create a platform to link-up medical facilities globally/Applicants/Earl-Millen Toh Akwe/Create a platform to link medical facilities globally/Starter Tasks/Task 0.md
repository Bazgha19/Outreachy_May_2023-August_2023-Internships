
# Task 0: 50 Hospitals globally.

### Researching Global Hospitals

For hospitals to connect, it is important to understand which facilities are open both locally and globally. The term "hospitals" in this context refers to all healthcare establishments.
Instead of being highly specialized facilities like eye or ear hospitals, hospitals should be general healthcare establishments where the various sub-units coexist.

### Methodology

- I used a variety of sources, including online databases, medical directories, and the websites of healthcare organizations, to undertake thorough research to achieve this goal. 
- Global hospitals are those that offer medical services in numerous nations and locations.
- Healthcare delivery methods varies between nations, and social problems, cultural misunderstandings, and political unrest can all have an impact on how well healthcare is delivered.
- The hospitals were chosen based on their reputation, size, and location, and the search was conducted using specific keywords pertaining to general medical services and hospital locations.
- Certain nations/regions, such as the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and European hospitals, are renowned for offering high-quality healthcare services. I thus carefully organized both well-known hospitals and less well-known hospitals.
- After gathering the data, I then assessed and evaluated each hospital based on the criteria indicated above. I also double-checked the data I got from each source to make sure it was reliable and accurate.


### issues encountered during research

Information isn't always commonly available: Some hospitals might not have a website or might not give thorough details on the services and facilities they offer.




## Results
  **note**:the hospitals offer more than this services provided on this file and the rest of their
  services can be found in the pdf file with every other information as well

I also made sure hospitals from developed and developing nations were included, as well as hospitals from all parts of the world. I also considered the variety of services that these hospitals provide, ranging from routine medical attention to advanced medical procedures.


## Conclusion

A significant tool for connecting hospitals and fostering collaborations between healthcare organizations is the [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wAYnJn-YbftgOtbWLc2POeZpGrTO4rfVKDSyeoyOTc/edit?usp=sharing) of 50 active worldwide hospitals I have developed as a result of my research. Healthcare workers, patients, and researchers looking to access medical institutions internationally will find this list to be of great help. I have also made data available in pdf format availble on this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wAYnJn-YbftgOtbWLc2POeZpGrTO4rfVKDSyeoyOTc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Upcoming Work
The following actions will be taken in relation to this project: 
- Creating the open source software that will enable hospitals to register their services and facilities.
- Developing a user-friendly interface to make it simple for patients, healthcare professionals, and hospitals to find hospitals based on their location and service offerings.
- Testing and debugging the application;
- Taking user comments into account to make it better.
