# Hospital Data Collection Tool

## Introduction
With the help of this assignment, hospitals will be able to sumbit data concerning them for a system both on-site and remotely. The tool will gather all the information required about the hospital, including its name, address, services provided, facilities offered, and other pertinent data. The steps I took to complete this assignment, from determining the crucial data required to monitoring and upgrading the tool, will be documented.

## Identification of Essential data needed
Prior to developing the data collection application, I determined the crucial data that hospitals would be asked to provide during the data collection process. This data consists of:
* Hospital Name
* Contact Information (Email)
* Location 
* Website
* Services Offered
* Facilities Available 


## Selecting the Data Collecting Tool
So there are various methods to collect data from hospitals but the best and easy way so far is by using online forms which can be availble every where there is communication network available.
 so i decide to creat 2 tools that can be use to creat 2 tools for this task
 *Web app built with flutter
 *Google forms

## Development of Flutter web app data collection tool
  - So i develop my data collection tool with flutter inorder to have more options and control over actions and users using my tool to which i can add future configurations and features to do what ever is require in future
  - Using  firebase as databse also gives advance data manipulation options and variouse means and method to analyse data with lots of stress.

## link to hospital data collection flutter web tool
 This tool is hosted on github providing free hosting to the tool

## Additions 
i also included the flutter build web code in this commit and you can access it  with the [link](/Create%20a%20platform%20to%20link-up%20medical%20facilities%20globally/Applicants/Earl-Millen%20Toh%20Akwe/Create%20a%20platform%20to%20link%20medical%20facilities%20globally/Starter%20Tasks/web/index.html)
With the flutter framework, i get acces to building and android app and an ios app for this tool. You can find the entire code to this tool on my github profile with the following link:

## UI and input interphase
The ui to this tool very standard, easy and straight to the point. 
The UI look like this on [phone. link to image](/Create%20a%20platform%20to%20link-up%20medical%20facilities%20globally/Applicants/Earl-Millen%20Toh%20Akwe/assets/images/flutter%20web%20app.jpeg)

## output
The output of the data inputs on my firebase data base looks like this: 
[output firebase](/Create%20a%20platform%20to%20link-up%20medical%20facilities%20globally/Applicants/Earl-Millen%20Toh%20Akwe/assets/images/firebase%20results.png)
(outputs are from the test carried out)

## issues faced 
in creating this tool, i faced and issue with free firebase hosting even after deployment the tool still wont load thats why i had to switch to github hosting

## Development of Google Form data collection tool
The fields required for gathering the important data were already pre-identified, and the data collection tool was constructed using Google Forms. The form's divisions and subsections were created to make it simpler for hospitals to enter their information and for system administrators to arrange the data they had gathered.

(outputs are from the test carried out)

## issues faced 
Face no issue in creating this tool.


## Message for Successful Form Submission Confirmation
Once the form has been submitted, the hospital will receive a confirmation message informing them that it was successful. The system administrator will take note of their contribution, thank them for it, and let them know that they can expect a response shortly.

## Observation and Updates to the Data Collecting Tool
The technology used to gather the data will be frequently checked to make sure it is operating properly and accurately recording each submission. The form will be swiftly updated or modified as needed to guarantee that it continues to meet the requirements of the hospitals and the system administrators.




## Conclusion
This work was effective in producing 2 data gathering tools that hospitals can use to register for a system both onsite and remotely. The program gathers crucial data about the hospital, such as its name, address, services provided, facilities offered, and other pertinent details. The technology offers hospitals a simple interfaces to enter their information, and system administrators can manage the data collected by utilizing Google Forms or the flutter web app. To make sure that it continues to satisfy the needs of the hospitals and the system administrators, the data gathering tool will be monitored and updated on a regular basis.
