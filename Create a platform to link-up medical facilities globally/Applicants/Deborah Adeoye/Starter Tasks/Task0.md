# Task 0: List of Hospitals
## Project Description
The objective of this research was to identify and create a list of 50 active global hospitals that offer general medical services where the sub-units co-exist, in order to facilitate linking up hospitals. The criteria for selection included their location, services offered, and links to their websites. In order to link up hospitals, it is essential to be aware of which hospital is operative, in your area and globally. 


## Methodology
To accomplish this objective, I conducted extensive research using various sources, including online databases, medical directories, and healthcare organization websites. The search was conducted using specific keywords related to general medical services and hospital locations, and the hospitals were selected based on their reputation, size, and geographical location.
After collecting the data, I then analyzed and evaluated each hospital based on the criteria mentioned above. I also verified the information obtained from each source to ensure accuracy and reliability.


## Results
Through my research, I was able to identify and compile a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140T5QApO6Qe8M5_6kxCp7IBTMxNURnmv3pZLROIaTt4/edit?usp=sharing) of 50 active global hospitals that meet the criteria. The list of hospitals researched and compiled includes a mix of public, private and academic medical facilities from different parts of the world. The hospitals are generally non-specialized and offer a range of medical services to patients.
Locations of the hospitals span across several continents with a significant number located in North America, Europe and Asia. The hospitals offered a wide range of medical services, including general medical care, specialized services, research, and education, and specialized care in areas such as oncology, cardiology, and pediatrics. Some of the common services offered by the hospitals included emergency care, outpatient services, inpatient services, and surgical services.

Some of the notable hospitals on the list include the Mayo Clinic in the United States, which is a top-ranked hospital renowned for its clinical excellence and research. The Johns Hopkins Hospital, also in the United States, is another top-ranked hospital known for its outstanding patient care and innovative research. The King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Saudi Arabia is a leading hospital in the Middle East region, providing specialized care and research facilities.
Overall, the list provides a broad overview of some of the active global hospitals and the range of services they offer to patients.

Additionally, I have provided links to the websites of each hospital to facilitate access to further information about the facilities and their services:

The criteria I used to select hospitals include:
* General medical facilities that offer various sub-units and services
* Active and operational hospitals
* Hospitals with a good reputation and experience in providing quality services

I also ensured that the list covers different regions of the world and includes hospitals from both developed and developing countries. Additionally, I took into account the diversity of services offered by these hospitals, ranging from general health care to specialized treatments and procedures.


## Project Tasks Completed
I have completed the following tasks as part of my contributions to this project:
- [x] Researched and compiled a list of 50 active global hospitals with their location, services offered, and links to their websites.
- [x] Organized the data in tabular form to make it easily accessible and understandable.


## Conclusion
The [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140T5QApO6Qe8M5_6kxCp7IBTMxNURnmv3pZLROIaTt4/edit?usp=sharing) of 50 active global hospitals that I have compiled through MY research will be a valuable resource for linking up hospitals and facilitating collaborations between healthcare organizations. This list will be particularly useful for healthcare professionals, patients, and medical researchers seeking to access medical facilities around the world.


## Future Work
The next steps for this project include:
* Developing the open source application that will allow hospitals to sign up and register their services and facilities.
* Creating a user-friendly interface for hospitals, healthcare professionals, and patients to easily search for hospitals based on the services they offer and location.
* Testing and debugging the application.
* Incorporating feedback from users to improve the application.
