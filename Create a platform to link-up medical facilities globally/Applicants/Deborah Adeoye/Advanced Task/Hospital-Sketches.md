# Sketches and Lo-Fi Wireframes for 3 Screens
This is my open source contribution as an Outreachy intern for Mboalab on GitHub. As part of my contribution, I have used user research to create sketches for 3 screens of a hospital-finding application including the Home/Dashboard screen, Search Screen, and Hospital Profile screen. Additionally, I have designed Lo-Fi wireframes for each screen to partially visualize my design.
<br>
The main objective of this contribution is to help users find hospitals globally and in their local area. The sketches and wireframes I have created aim to provide users with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for searching for hospitals and finding important information about them.
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Proposed User flow for Data Collection:
1. Hospital fills out the data collection form with relevant information such as name, location, facilities, and services available.
2. Upon form submission, a confirmation message is displayed.
3. System administrator reviews the data submitted and approves the registration.
4. The hospital is notified of the approval status.
5. Approved hospital information is added to the app's database.

## Proposed User flow for Final Usage:
1. User opens the app and is directed to the login/registration screen.
2. User creates an account or logs in.
3. User is directed to the app dashboard which displays a list of hospitals in their area.
4. User can filter hospitals by location or services available.
5. User can select a hospital from the list and view more details about it, such as facilities available and contact information.
6. User can save their preferred hospitals to their profile.
7. User can search for hospitals by name or location.
8. User can view their saved hospitals and their contact information.
9. User can provide feedback or ratings for hospitals they have visited.
10. User can access a help or support section for any issues or questions they may have.


## Screens Designed
The following are the sketches and wireframes for the three main screen I have designed for this contribution: <br>

**Home/Dashboard Screen** - This screen provides users with a dashboard to access different features of the application. Users can choose to search for hospitals, access their saved hospitals, or view their profile information.<br>

**Search Screen** - This screen allows users to search for hospitals by name, location, or service offered. Users can also filter their search results based on different criteria such as hospital rating or distance from their current location.<br>

**Hospital Profile Screen** - This screen displays detailed information about a selected hospital. Users can view the hospital's location, services offered, contact information, and other information.<br>

## Next Steps
My next step for this project is to create Hi-Fis and prototypes for each of the screens. These Hi-Fis and prototypes will help to better visualize my design and give a more accurate representation of the final product.

## Sketches and Wireframes
The sketches and wireframes for each screen are included in the '[Assets](https://github.com/dearlydebbie/Outreachy_May_2023-August_2023-Internships/tree/Advanced-Task/Create%20a%20platform%20to%20link-up%20medical%20facilities%20globally/Applicants/Deborah%20Adeoye/Advanced%20Task/Assets)' folder of this repository. <br>

## Note
These designs are only meant to serve as a starting point and are subject to change based on feedback and further development.
