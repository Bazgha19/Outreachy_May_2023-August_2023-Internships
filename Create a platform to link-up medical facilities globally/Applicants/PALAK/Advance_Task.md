Advance Task

## Advance Task : Link-up Hospital application

#### APPROACH ->

- I have created an application using wireframe.cc for basic designing and flutter for making it creative and presentable.

- Wireframe.cc is a quick and efficient tool for putting together some simple wireframes.Images are added in a folder-[Wireframe_Images](https://github.com/Palaktahlyani/Link_Up_Hospital_Application/tree/master/Wireframe_Images)

- Application is build considering the concept of MVP that is minimum viable product and includes 4 screens.

- First screen is Welcome screen which consist of a logo and three buttons Log In,Sign Up and a skip button.

- Second screen is Log In screen where there are two fileds and a button also an animated image.

- Third screen is Sign Up screen where there are four filed of basic information.

- Forth screen is main screen,includes Location and profile icon at the top, a box which give details to list the hospital,search bar,a grid of six elements and navbar.

-Here is the link of an Application-[Application Link](https://github.com/Palaktahlyani/Link_Up_Hospital_Application)

-I have also added the video in a [README](https://github.com/Palaktahlyani/Link_Up_Hospital_Application/blob/master/README.md)
