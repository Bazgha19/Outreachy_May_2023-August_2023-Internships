## Task 0: List of Hospitals

#### APPROACH ->

- I started my research with a google search. I found too many articles, and by filtering a few of them with the most likes and views I continued my research by taking out the best fifty.

- To check whether the hospitals are active and operative, I used one of the intelligent and smart tools that is CHATGPT. After verifying, I visited their websites where they mentioned their social media handles. while checking the social handles I checked when they posted last. Also, through LinkedIn, I came over to the job section to check the status of their current jobs. Many of them already posted about the job opening on their website itself.

- After subtracting a few hospitals (which were inactive or did not have much activity) from my list I added more hospitals, then repeated this approach.

- I updated my list with fifty active and operative general hospitals in my area and globally with their Name, Locations, services offered, and links to their website -
