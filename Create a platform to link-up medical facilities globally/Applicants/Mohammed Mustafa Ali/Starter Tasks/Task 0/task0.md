I have compiled a list of active hospitals including countries like Cameroon, USA, and India.

I made an Excel Sheet for convenience and future improvements in the Data.

The List of Key Information Regarding the Hospitals include:

1.Hospital Name
2.Hospital Address
3.Hospital City
4.Hospital Country
5.Hospital Zip-Code
6.Hospital Website
7.Hospital's Services eg: Treatment of Cancer, Heart Diseases etc.
8.Hospital's Facilities eg: MRI, Ultrasound, Blood Test etc.


* In the Facilities "All Advanced Diagnostice Tools Available" means the Hospital is well equipped with all the Testing Facilities.
