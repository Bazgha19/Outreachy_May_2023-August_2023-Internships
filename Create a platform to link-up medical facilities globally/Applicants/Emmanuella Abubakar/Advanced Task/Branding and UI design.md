## Methodology and Results
### Brand name
1. To choose a brand name for this project, I considered some factors which includes:
    - The sector in which the project falls under which is health
    - The aim of the project which is to "improve access to healthcare"
    - The core values of the project which I defined to be Accessibility, Trustworthiness, Stability and Reliability.
 
2. Brainstomed and explored different names like:
    - Medicare
    - Hospitallink
    - Crosslink
    - Favicare
    - Mboalab
 
3. Selected **"Crosslink"** as a name that best fits the platform. To select a name from my list, I considered the name that wuill communicate what the platform is about and what it aims to do. For Crosslink, the cross signifies hospitals and the link communicates that it primary aim is to connect hospitals.

### Brand colors
I applied thesame process i followed for selecting a brand name to how I selected the brand color for Crosslink. I considered colors that will:
1. Use color psychology to communicate that the project is a healthcare project; colors that can be associated with a helathcare brand
2. Communicate the aim of the platform which is to Improve access to healthcare
3. Reinforce the core values of the platform
4. Have a very good contrast to meet the accessibility standard 

### Logo design
- For the logo design, I still followed thesame process I used for selecting a brand name and color. 
- I also used a [logo design brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1WMG8abjbuIW_s5Z8n5a1rPBZmXR7fp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113626955331922029315&rtpof=true&sd=true) which aided in coming up with  a concept of what I wanted based on some questions and the answers I provided.
- Several concepts were designed using canva before I selected my preference and the best fit.
- Selected logo:

### Style guide
To start working on the UI design, I started by curating a style guide to ensure consistency and efficiency during my UI design process. The style guide also helped me to  maintain a consistent brand image across the UI design. For the entirety of the componets of the style guide, I ensured it reinforced the brand message and core values. E.g selection of fonts, design of input fields, etc.

The [style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/bjTDjyIczQL8LD0iA7rF99/Mboalab?node-id=13%3A3350&t=fPTiEQygIUYqe6Xq-1) covers:
- Color system
- Typography
- Spacing system
- Reusable components like buttons, dropdown, input fields, navbar, alerts and notifications, etc.

### Hifi designs
In the research document, I outlined the ideas that the MVP of the healthcare mobile app will have. I also created user stories for use cases of the app. Due to the time constraint, I created hifi designs for the flow of the 2 user stories for a patient. 
1. As a patient I want to [sign up](https://www.figma.com/file/bjTDjyIczQL8LD0iA7rF99/Mboalab?node-id=222%3A14760&t=fPTiEQygIUYqe6Xq-1) so that i can search for hospitals close to me

2. As a patient I want to [book an appointment](https://www.figma.com/file/bjTDjyIczQL8LD0iA7rF99/Mboalab?node-id=222%3A17753&t=fPTiEQygIUYqe6Xq-1) so that I can meet a doctor for consultation

### Prototype
After creating the hifi designs for the two user stories, I used figma to add interactions and create a prototype of the designs. 
The prototype video can be viewed below:

## Conclusion
Working on this task was a very enjoyable experience for me. I was finally able to bring my ideas to life. I had to make the design as simple as possible with the mind of not compromising the design quality and to aid a less complicated implementation. With the work done so far, there is still a lot more to be done like user testing, iterating on UI designs, designing screens for hospitals, more screens for patients and other things but this is a starting point.
