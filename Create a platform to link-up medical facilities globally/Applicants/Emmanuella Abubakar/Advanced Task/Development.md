## Introduction
The aim of this part of the advanced task is to develop the mobile screens designed earlier using flutter framework and dart programming language.

## Tools
- Google chrome
- Google drive
- Android studio
- Visual studio
- Visual studio code
- Flutter, dart programming language

## Methodology
The process I followed to carry out this task is as follows:
- I searched online for beginner flutter tutorials and documentations that could guide in the development of my designs. Then I reached out to my friends that develop mobile apps using flutter and they were open to guide me. Due to the time constraint, only one was available as at the time I slotted for it.
- I used the tutorials I searched for on youtube and google to download the tools i needed to setup up the flutter environment. 
- After setting up the environment, I read up and continued the flutter tutorial on youtube to get hands-on knowledge on flutter.
- After the tutorials on flutter, I reached out to my friend regarding the development of the designs, then we got to work on it.
- When all the screens have been developed, I pushed the code to github and made the repository public. 

## Result
- The code base of the healthcare app can be accessed via this **[LINK](https://github.com/emmanuellabubakar/Crosslink-Mobile-App)**
- The video of the app can be accessed via this **[LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQu4rlgzbb6_JFm923vA-1NB-B-01--S/view?usp=sharing)** and viewed below:

## Conclusion
The development of the designs has truly been a learning process for me. I wrote my first mobile development code with flutter and developed my first mobile app.  Although, at first I was confused and setting up the development environment was really frustrating. Later on, it became a little bit easier especially with the aid of the tutorials and my friends's assistance. For future development on this healthcare project, I plan to watch more tutorials and practice more so the development process can be easier and smoother for me.
