# Task 0: List of hospitals
**Main activities to complete:**
- Research and create a list of 50 active global hospitals
- Take into consideration their location, services offered and links to their websites.

**Task objective:**
In order to link up hospitals, it is essential to be aware of which hospital is operative, in your area and globally. Hospitals in this context refer to medical facilities in general. The hospitals should not be specialized such as eye, or ear but rather general services medical facilities where the sub-units co-exist.

## Conclusion
I have been able to successfully curate a list of 50 operational hospitals; both local or global from 6 continents - Africa, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America, South America. They offer general medical services and other specialized services. 

The list was compiled from various data sources like; government Health department websites and hospital directories, search engine results, google map. I intended to use WHO GHFD databse but the global database is not available yet.

I discovered that some regions do not have enough medical facilities in comparison to other regions. I also discovered that Antarctica does not have general hospitals because civillians do not live there and it is only inhabited by scientists who have in-house medical facilities and personnels. 

This task was enlightening as it made me discover new knowledge about medical facilities and Antarctica as continent. It also reinforced the need for this project to make health care easily accessible.
