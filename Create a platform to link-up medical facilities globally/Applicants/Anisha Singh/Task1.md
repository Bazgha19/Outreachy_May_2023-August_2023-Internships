## Task 1: Hospital's Data Collection Tool

# Objective
The purpose of a data collection tool is to provide a reliable and efficient means of collecting data that is necessary for achieving specific goals or objectives. The tool will collect necessary information about the hospital, including name, location, services offered, facilities available, and other relevant information, allowing them to register themselves to the platform provided.

Providing access to quality healthcare services to people in different parts of the world can be facilitated with the help of this tool.

# Key features
* This tool is hosted on a platform which is open and easily accessible.
* One of the most notable features of this tool is its form-like interface that allows for easy data collection from users.
* To add a personal creative & personal touch, I have utilized the logo I designed for Mboalab and incorporated it into this tool. Additionally, I plan to use the same logo for my Flutter app.
* This tool was created entirely from scratch, rather than being an existing tool that was modified or adapted.

  The added fields include :
 1. Hospital Name
 2. Services offered
 3. Other Facilities Provided
 4. Number of beds
 5. Address (country,city, pincode)
 6. Contact details(Website or Phone number)
