# Tools
## Figma: 

I utilized Figma to produce these designs.

## Font-Awesome Icon:

* Font Awesome is a library of over 7,000 scalable vector icons that can be customized to match the design style of an application or website.
* These icons can be used for a variety of purposes, such as navigation menus, buttons, and other interface elements.
* They are often used in place of traditional image icons as they are lightweight, easily scalable, and can be styled with CSS.

# Conclusion
I am currently in the process of designing these screens for Project 1, which involves creating a platform that connects medical facilities worldwide.
This is not the final product, as I may continue to add more screens while taking into account the user's perspective and the needs of hospitals to 
list their facilities.
