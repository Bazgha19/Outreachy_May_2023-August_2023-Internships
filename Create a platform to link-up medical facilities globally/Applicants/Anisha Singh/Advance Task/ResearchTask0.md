# Objective
Hi there ðŸ‘‹, the purpose of my contribution is to highlight the initial stage of the design process, which involves creating a visual representation of a page or screen layout and content. This representation, known as a wireframe, is created without the inclusion of finer details such as colors, typography, or images.

Also, it's important to note that the Flutter app design I am sharing is not the final version, but rather a preview or prototype of my approach to the app. I may continue to refine and improve the design, going back and forth until I am satisfied with the final product. I will be sure to provide updates as I make progress towards the completed design.

# Learnings

## What exactly is Wirefaming ?
Wireframing is a visual representation of a web page, mobile app, or software user interface that outlines the basic layout, structure, and functionality of the interface. It is typically the first step in the design process and is used to communicate the layout and content of a page or screen without getting bogged down in details like colors, typography, or images.

**Some Advantages**
* Planning and organization: Wireframes allow developers and designers to plan the layout and organization of an app's interface before starting the development process. They help to establish a clear understanding of how different elements will be structured and arranged within the app.

* Early feedback: Wireframes are an effective way to gather early feedback from stakeholders and end-users before investing time and resources into development. Since wireframes are quick and easy to create, they can be iterated upon quickly to reflect feedback and changes.

* Navigation and usability: Wireframes help to identify any potential issues with navigation and usability. Since wireframes are a low-fidelity representation of the interface, it is easy to see how users will navigate through the app and identify any potential issues or obstacles that may arise.

# Tools (I used during my designing process)
In this contribution, I am sharing a list of valuable tools and resources that can be beneficial for new users, as well as highlighting some of the challenges I encountered during the design process. This includes providing information on where to access free icons, templates for reference, and other useful resources that can assist with designing the Wireframe model.

## Figma

Figma is a web-based user interface (UI) design tool that allows designers to create and collaborate on design projects in real-time. It is similar to other design tools like Adobe XD and Sketch, but Figma stands out because it is entirely cloud-based, which means that designers can work on their projects from anywhere with an internet connection. Figma also includes features like prototyping, vector networks, and plugins, which make it a popular choice for designers and design teams.

I was introduced to this tool by my mentor **@Aigen Petra**(**Petra Ukeh**), and I am grateful for the opportunity to have discovered and learned how to use this exceptional tool.

## Dribble

* Dribbble is a social media platform for designers and creative professionals.
* The platform allows designers to showcase their work and get feedback from other designers.
* It is often used as a portfolio site for designers to post their design work, including graphics, illustrations, animations, and user interface (UI) designs.
* Other designers can view, appreciate, and comment on the work of their peers.
* Dribbble can be a great source of inspiration for new designers to gather ideas and references, which they can then incorporate into their own unique design concepts.

## Font Awesome Icon

* Font Awesome is a library of over 7,000 scalable vector icons that can be customized to match the design style of an application or website.
* These icons can be used for a variety of purposes, such as navigation menus, buttons, and other interface elements.
* Font Awesome icons are designed to be easy to implement and are compatible with a wide range of development frameworks and programming languages.
* They are often used in place of traditional image icons as they are lightweight, easily scalable, and can be styled with CSS.
* Font Awesome provides a vast range of icons covering different categories and styles, making it a valuable resource for designers and developers to access high-quality icons for their projects.
* The library is frequently updated with new icons and features, ensuring that designers always have access to the latest iconography.
* The best part of this tool is there are a variety of free icons available to choose from.

## Icon 3D set

* Icon 3D sets can be used to create a more visually appealing and immersive user experience by adding depth and realism to the design.
* Icon 3D sets are collections of three-dimensional icons that are designed to add depth and dimensionality to the user interface of an application.

## Random Hue

* Random hue is often used in digital design and graphics, particularly for generating color schemes or palettes for web design, branding, or other visual.
* Using random hue in Figma can be a helpful way to quickly explore different color options without getting stuck in decision-making or overthinking color choices.

# Conclusion
In my experience, using Figma has been incredibly beneficial for breaking down larger tasks into sub-tasks. As I completed a recent project, I found that using Figma allowed me to approach the task in a step-by-step manner, resulting in a more creative and efficient process overall. Through my research, I was able to create a comprehensive guide for beginners and those who are unfamiliar with Figma, making it easier for them to learn and utilize its helpful design tools. I believe that my this research will be a valuable resource for new contributors who are looking to use Figma for their own design projects.
