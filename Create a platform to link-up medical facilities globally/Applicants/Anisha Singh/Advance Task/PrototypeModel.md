# Objective
 I designed this Flutter app to facilitate hospitals in listing their services and allow users to browse through the available services.
 
## Tools utilized 
**Flutter**: 
* Flutter is a mobile app SDK (software development kit) that enables developers to create natively compiled apps for mobile, web, and desktop platforms from a single codebase.
* Flutter uses Dart programming language, which is easy to learn and write.
* Flutter offers a rich set of customizable widgets that can help create beautiful, responsive, and fast UI/UX designs.
* By utilizing my Figma design, I was able to develop the Flutter UI in a way that closely aligned with the design.


# Conclusion
 The current outcome is not final, as I have been continuously updating the UI designs to match the actual app. Although Flutter is a new technology for
 me, I enjoy challenging myself and learning new skills.
