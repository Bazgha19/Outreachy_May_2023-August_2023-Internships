For my advancedtask, I made use of google Docs to document my user research and timeline.
I used a figjam file for my ideation,ranging from my empathy map creation,Idea prioritazation matrix, brainstorming to my features list.
And lastly,I used figma to create my components, my low fidelity design, my high fidelity design and prototype.
Here, i'll be adding the links to the above listed files.
