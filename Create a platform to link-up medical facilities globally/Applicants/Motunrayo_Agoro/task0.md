Project Description
The goal of this research task is to generate and create a list of 50 active global general hospitals that offer general medical services where the subunits co-exists, in order to facilitate linking up medical facilities. The standards for choice incorporated their location, services offered, and links to their websites. To connect up medical clinics, it is fundamental to know about which medical clinic is usable, in your space and universally. I led broad research utilizing, clinical registries database, and medical services association websites. The search was led based on the hospital size, their standing and geographical location.

Research result
I curated a list of 50 hospitals that span across the continent with larger percentages located in countries across Africa, Europe, and Asia countries and few in North-America, South-America, and Australia. They are also curated based on  their affordability to the public, private hospitals. They offer general medical services to their patients and provide a wide range of services like cardiology, neurology, oncology to mention a few.
I will be listing the names of these hospitals here and also submit a link to a google spreadsheet where I have curated the hospital in Names,Type, Location, service offered, and website link. The google sheet is provided to make the hospital lists look neat, well arranged and to make it easy for readers to look at the list.

Here is the link to a full detailed google sheet on the list of 50 hospitals stating location, hospital type, services rendered and website link.

Conclusion
This full list of 50 active global hospitals I have collected together by doing proper research will be an important asset for linking up hospital facilities to patients/hospitals together. This will be useful for medical personnels, organization, patients, and researchers looking for access to medical facilities
