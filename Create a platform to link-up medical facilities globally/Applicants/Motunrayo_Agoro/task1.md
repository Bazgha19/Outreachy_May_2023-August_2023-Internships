Task description
to create a data collection tool where hospitals cam sign up for the system.

solution
i created the sign up tool using a jotform which is a webapp where users can create tools for data collection. while curating the data hospitas need to fill, to make patients feel save, i took into consideration the hospital location, type, service offered, ffacilities availabe, proper identification process, hospital website and every other information needed for the sign up process.
I tested the tool to be sure it works perfectly
