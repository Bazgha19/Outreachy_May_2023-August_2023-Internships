 # Advanced Task
## Create a platform to Link up Platform
### Design Process for Hospital Link up App
* Statement of Problem: There is limited access to medical facilities and this has been affecting the health sector globally.
* Goal: Creating a platform to access medical facilities globally and give external collaborators access to data that facilitates easy access to medical services globally.

### EMPATHIZE
I carried out user research to identify the pain points of health care providers and to find out how they feel about the link up platform that would improve healthcare system globally. I made interview scripts to guide the users. Some of the questions I asked include:
* What does your typical day looks like
* What is the favorite thing about your career 
* What type of hospital do you work (Private/ Public)
* How do you seek for medical facilities outside your hospital
* Can you tell me about the last time you needed to get a facility outside your hospital
* How does having limited access to facilities make you feel
* How long does it take to reach out or communicate with other hospital that have the facilities you need
* What are the challenges you’ve faced while seeking for medical facilities 
* What is the interaction with other hospital like
* What do you think would make communication with other hospital easier and faster
* Do you think a platform to link up with other hospital globally would help make the health sector a better place.

Responses showed that health care workers go through tough time when they need medical facilities, according to the feedback it takes days to reach out to hospitals when you are in need of a medical service. The healthcare providers loved the idea of being able to link up with hospitals and other health care workers globally. They are open to adopting new methods to provide their patients with even access to medical facilities and to collaborate with other health care providers globally.
