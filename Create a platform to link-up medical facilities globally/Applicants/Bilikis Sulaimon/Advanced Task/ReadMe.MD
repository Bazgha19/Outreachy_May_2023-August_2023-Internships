### Solution to Advanced Task
Hi everyone, this is the solution to my advanced task and the design for my app which i decided to name “HealthLink” App.I divided it into sections using the design process method
### SKETCHES
I made sketches to note down my ideas before implementation. You can find them in the sketch link
### WIREFRAME/LO FI
I made a two dimensional skeletal image to guide my designs before the hi fidelity prototype.

 ### USER FLOW

I made a user flow from the login page to the home page to guide the users.

### HI FIDELITY PROTOTYPE

i used figma for my designs made 13 screens for the hospital Link up app putting into consideration the user interface and user experience, i made it simple so that users would be able to navigate through the app easily
### PROTOTYPE

I made sure the screens were linked together to give a peek of what the designs would look like after implementation. i also tetsted it and fixed the bugs.

Link to each of my works are placed in the advanced folder.

Summary

I have been able to  research on how to improve the problems of the health sector and how to solve the hospital link up and also I have been able to put those solutions into designs. I have learnt a lot during this contribution phase and looking forward to learning more
