# TASK 1: Hospital Data Collection Tool
## Introduction
Healthcare is a highly complex sector that has been difficult to change. Around the world, healthcare has struggled with uneven access and quality for decades. Although patients, providers and payers are all calling for change, the healthcare sector has been largely resistant to outside disruption.
Around the world, health-care systems differ widely. Countries adopt different systems to provide healthcare to their citizens, with different levels of government and private sector involvement. A platform to access medical facilities globally gives external collaborators access to data to advance healthcare without the data ever leaving the platform.
 
## Objective
This data collection tool will be used by hospitals to sign up for the system and it can be used remotely and onsite taking into consideration important information like name, location, address, service and facilities available, website links e.t,c .

## Creating the Data collection tool
<br>
Google form was used as the data collection tool as the form was designed in such a way to reduce the possibility of errors in recording and it has the ability to distribute surveys to larger audiences remotely and on site.  I started with a descriptive title of the form that would make it easy for hospitals to understand the importance of the platform.

## Testing tool
I sent out the form link to medical practitioners to fill out for testing and their responses were successfully recorded and I was also able to receive and review responses.
 
## Conclusion








I have successfully created a tool for hospitals to sign up both remotely and on site, I have also successfully tested the tool and got positive feedback, and I would be able to receive and review data collected with this tool.
