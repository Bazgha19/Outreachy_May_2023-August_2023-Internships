My name is Eineje Victor Ameh, a third year Mechatronics Engineering student in the University of Debrecen Hungary. 
My interests are Machine learning as well as cyber security I have worked with the SLAM (Simultaneous localization and Mapping) algorithm in school and the main aim for that project was to detect when a robot was lost .
I am very good at working with teams to share norms and ideas and I will do my best to contribute to this open source project (as it is my first) of creating a platform to link up medical facilities globally.
