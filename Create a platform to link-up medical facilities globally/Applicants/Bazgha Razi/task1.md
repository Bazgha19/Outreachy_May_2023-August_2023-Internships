# Data Collection Tool

## Objective

This data collection tool will be used by hospitals to sign-up for the system. create a data collection tool for hospitals which can be used remotely and onsite. 
The tool should take into consideration the name, location, services and facilities available alongside other relevant information.

## Create a tool

This tool is created using google forms. Google forms are used widely so I use this to collect data from the hospitals and store them in the excel sheet for easy access.

## Test the tool

Tool is tested after creating and it's working fine. For future we can review the data and then according to that we can delete from the excel sheet if any detail is duplicate.
