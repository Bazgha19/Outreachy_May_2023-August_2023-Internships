# Business Requirement for the MedLink APP

*Introduction*

In today's world, a lack of knowledge poses a major threat to life and raises the mortality rate. Hospitals across the world cure a variety of ailments; however, determining which hospital can treat which patient and where it is situated is a huge difficulty for both medical workers and patients. The goal of this initiative is to connect hospitals so that they may exchange resources and information based on the services they provide. Patients' treatment may be greatly facilitated, and the referral process simplified, if hospitals are aware of which hospitals provide which treatments and in which locations. This will cut death rates since not only hospitals, but also patients, will be able to explore which hospitals offer treatment for which ailments and in which places throughout the world.

*Problem Statement*

The lack of information in today's age is a significant challenge for both health personnel and patients. It is also challenging for patients to find hospitals that offer treatment for specific diseases, and in the right location. This creates a barrier to treatment, which leads to increased mortality rates.

----
*Solution*

To address this challenge, we propose an open-source application that connects hospitals worldwide to share information about their facilities and services. Hospitals can sign up and register the various facilities and services as per their location, and other hospitals can easily refer patients, or patients can easily locate a hospital for each case. This saves time, money, and most importantly, reduces mortality rates. The application will include the following key features:

- Hospital Registration and Profile Creation:
Hospitals can register themselves and create a profile with information such as location, contact details, services offered, and the diseases they can treat. Hospitals can also update their profile as their services change or new services are added.

- Search for Hospitals by Location and Disease:
Patients can easily search for hospitals that offer treatment for specific diseases in different locations worldwide. The application will enable patients to search by name, servicies, facilities, diseases and  location, making it easier to find the right hospital for their needs.

- Hospital Listing and Details:
The hospital screen will show the list of hospitals around the location of the user. When I search for an hospital, it will change the list to the list of all hospitals that matches the criteria I used in searching. Patients can select a hospital to view more information, including contact details, facilities, services offered, and the diseases they can treat.

- Referral:
We will need to include a referral system that allows hospitals communicate in real-time, and refer patients to other hospitals that offer the specialized treatment needed by the patient.  We will work on the functionality in a way that hospitals will be able to refer patients to hospitals that offer services that they do not provide, or to hospitals that have more advanced facilities or specialized medical staff.

- Secure and User-Friendly Interface
A lot of data will be shared, while making sure that they are secured, the app will have a very friendly user interface that is easy to navigate and use with great experience. It will also include a secure login system to protect patient and hospital data.
