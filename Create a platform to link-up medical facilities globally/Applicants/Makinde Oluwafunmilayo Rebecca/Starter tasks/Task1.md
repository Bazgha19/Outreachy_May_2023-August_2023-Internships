# Hospital Tool

To create the necessary tool to gather data, a google form will do a perfect job thereby preventing hosting and maintenance cost if a website were to be used. 
Another advantage is, we can easily send those data to an excel sheet in an organized format which can be used for analysis too.

The necessary information needed for a complete registration has to be decided for the tool. Based on my research, The information will need to span across 5 pages of the form tool. Here are the information that will be required
