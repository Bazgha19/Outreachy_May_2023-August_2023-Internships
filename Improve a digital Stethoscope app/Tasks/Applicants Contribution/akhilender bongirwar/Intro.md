### Tech Enthusiast

My name is Akhilender Bongirwar. I am pursuing my Bachelors in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. 
I am learning flutter and am very much interested to contribute to improve-digital-Stethoscope-app.

The reason for choosing this project is, I like it when I can put forward the skills I learned into developing the tech which will be helpful for us in the day-to-day life.

Looking forward to connect, learn and work under the guidance of my mentors.
