### 🔸Advance task- Implementation of Audio recording and recorded audio player
👩🏽‍💻<strong>Code</strong> ➡️ https://github.com/ruqaiyasattar/digitalstethoecopeAI/pull/26
<br><strong>Greetings,<br> </strong>
I have made some updates to the advance task I completed before. I would like to give a brief overview of the changes and all the other features added by me.<br>
Firstly I added an app icon to make the app visually appealing.<br>
In the roles page I improved the design of next button – aligned it to the center and added a gradient background<br>
In the home page there is a recording section and a audio playing section. 
On clicking the mic button recording starts- a toast message appears "recording started". 
I was very much attracted towards google voice assistant’s ripple animation, thus I included the same in the project. 
While recording ripple animation is produced. 
on pressing the recording stop icon – recording stops and toast message appears "recording stopped".<br>
In the recorded audio playing section.
We can play a pause the audio recording. I have also added the audio waveform feature.<br><br>

<br>Currently, the recording is saved in local storage, but it can be improved by using Database. <br>
