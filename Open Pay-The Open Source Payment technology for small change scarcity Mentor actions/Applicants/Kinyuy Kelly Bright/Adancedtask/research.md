## Observation
From my observation, all the existing solution have have this common characteristic of high 
security which is a key factor expecially when it has to do with money,most of them only keep
track of your transaction details and do not share personsal information such as passwords,bank card 
numbers etc.
Based on my research, some of this payment solutions only work on some devices and other,you
can't use some without a bank card and these payment solution do not accept really small amount 
of money.
## proposed solution
If Open pay could be made to work even without a bank card ,work on all kinds of devices ,then kt will
it will be great.
