Project Description
The shortage of coins, particularly small denominations, is a serious problem in many countries and can have a detrimental impact on commercial activities. The situation affects sellers who see their turnover drop considerably because to sell, they must first have the small change to give back to consumers who, in most cases, come with banknotes. In order to solve this problem we want to develop an open-source technology that combines a mobile app with a miniaturized hardware system to transform any smart device into a payment tool is an ambitious and challenging project. However, with the right team and resources, it is certainly feasible.

To achieve this, we would be going through the following process to develop this technology

Conduct market research: Before developing any technology, it's important to understand the market and identify potential customers. Conducting market research will help determine the demand for this type of technology and what features and functionalities potential users would expect.

Assemble a team: Developing a complex technology like this will require a team of skilled professionals, including software developers, hardware engineers, and designers. It's important to ensure that the team members have the necessary expertise and experience to build this technology.

Develop a prototype: Once the team has been assembled, the next step is to develop a working prototype of the technology. This will involve designing the hardware and software components, and testing them to ensure they work together seamlessly.

Test and refine: Once the prototype is complete, it's important to test it thoroughly to identify any bugs or issues. User testing and feedback will also be essential to ensure the technology is user-friendly and meets the needs of potential customers. Based on feedback, the team can refine the technology to improve its functionality and usability.

Launch and maintain: Once the technology is ready, it can be launched and made available to the public. It's important to ensure ongoing maintenance and support to ensure the technology remains functional and up-to-date with the latest security measures.
The aim is to create an open-source technology that transforms any smart device into a payment tool with the potential to revolutionize the way people make payments and to solve small change scarcity. While ensuring that the technology is secure, user-friendly, and meets the needs of potential customers.

We are looking for skilled innovators to achieve this gaol, skill personnel include:

Project managers
Software developers
Hardware engineers
Product designers
Product researchers
Technical and content writers
