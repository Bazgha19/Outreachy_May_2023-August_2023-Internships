Research on already existing similar solutions

Small change scarcity is a common problem in many countries where the value of the smallest denomination of currency is very low compared to the cost of goods and services. This often results in difficulties for businesses and consumers to transact in cash, as they struggle to find enough coins and small bills to make exact change.

There are several existing solutions to address small change scarcity
I will be reviewing and analysis on 2 tech company that build a platform under each exiting solution and giving their strength and weaknesses

Round-Up payment solution
A round-up payment solution is a great way to address the scarcity of small change and help consumers save money. The idea behind a round-up payment solution is to round up purchases to the nearest dollar or another set amount and apply the difference to a savings account, debt payment, or other designated use. This solution not only helps consumers save money but also reduces the need for small change and the associated costs of producing and handling it. Round-up payment solutions are increasingly popular and can be implemented in a variety of ways, including through mobile banking apps, credit card issuers, and third-party financial technology providers.

Strengths:
-Round-up payment solutions are a simple and convenient way for consumers to save money and make small payments without the need for cash or small change.
-They can help address the problem of small change scarcity, reducing the need for coin and bill production and circulation, which can be costly for governments and businesses.
-Round-up payment solutions can be easily integrated into existing payment systems and mobile banking apps, making them accessible to a wide range of consumers.

Weakness:
-Round-up payment solutions may not be suitable for consumers who do not have bank accounts or credit cards, which could exclude certain groups of people who rely on cash transactions.
-Consumers may be concerned about the security of their financial information when linking their bank accounts or credit cards to a round-up payment solution.
-Some consumers may not see the benefits of using a round-up payment solution, especially if they are not able to save significant amounts of money through small, incremental payments.
