Proposed color for the brand identity

Blue
Blue is a popular color for fintech business as it represents trust, stability, and confidence. Blue is a color that people associate with professionalism, reliability, and security. In the financial industry, trust and reliability are essential qualities, so using blue as the primary color for a fintech business can help build trust and credibility with customers.

Green
Green is often associated with money and wealth, making it a natural choice for a fintech business. In the context of finance, green is a color that can represent growth, progress, and prosperity. It suggests that customers can achieve their financial goals by investing and saving with the company.

Charcoal gray: Charcoal gray is a dark, neutral color that can add depth and sophistication to a color that includes navy blue and lime green. It can be used as an accent color for text, buttons, or borders to create a sense of contrast and balance.

Hex color code for the brand

Primary color
Dark blue : #000080

A lot of brands use light, royal and other blue, i chose this blue in other to have a brand that stands out and still give value to target audience

Secondary color
Lime green: 00FF00
Green generally depicts money, wealth, nature and environment.  To make this brand stand out, I decided to go for a green that ( though used in fintech brands) not many brands use this color and yet it stands out and speaks volume. This color will stick into the target audience's memory at once.

Greys
Charcoal gray: #36454F
This color is to tone down any contrast and balance the color brand

Instead of the normal #00000, this hex color stands out as a dark color
