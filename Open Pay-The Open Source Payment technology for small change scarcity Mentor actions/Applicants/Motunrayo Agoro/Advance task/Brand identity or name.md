Brand Identity
Based on the project problem (small change scarcity), Brand vision, mission and users. some keywords were identified in  which the whole is all about. These keywords are

Open source payment solution
Small change scarcity
Open source technology

 Analysis
INoticed all what the project is about centered around a keyword which is “SMALL CHANGE” or “CHANGE” which in this project context means “small money” or “money” 

Also deduced that this project has to deal with a form of exchange in which the english word is “payment” 

I understand that it is an open source project

Just like we have Apple pay, google pay, samsung pay, paypal… 

We are looking for a keyword that is memorable (sticks at once), easy to pronounce, and reflective of the project's personality and values

Also thought of a name that will be simple to call since the project will deal with small (local business)
Also thought a name that can be adopted for a hardware device when built

Brand Name
“Change Pay”



Tag Line
“Solution to small change scarcity”
This tagline brings out the project mission in it simplest form

Domain Name
Before this brand name is used, it has been verified to not being used or trademark before
While looking for a domain name around this brand name
I found out someone has bought “changepay.com” and wants to sell
So i checked for a domain name that has not been used around this brand name which is
“Changepaysolution.com” or “smallchangepay.com”
The domain to be used can be verified before adopting any domain name

 used “.com” because it is the easiest and simplest domain name to remember 

We are open to suggestion on what domain name to adopt for this
