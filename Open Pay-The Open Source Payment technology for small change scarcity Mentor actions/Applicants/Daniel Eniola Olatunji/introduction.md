Hello, Good day!

My name is **Daniel Eniola Olatunji**. It is quite the privilege for me to partake in the MboaLabs project, particularly the Open Pay Project; I am excited, as well as elated because of the Cyber Security aspect of this project.

I have not had much real life experience when it comes to things Cyber Security, but I have well pertaken in several Cyber Security Hackathons including CySec Hackathon, DefCon, NaijaSecCon, amongst others.
And I have some theoretical knowledge about DevSecOps; regarding software development.

I picked this project to improve my Cyber Security skills and have real life and hand-ons experience, and to use my Cyber Security skills/expertise; no matter how little to contribute to something that will leave a positive impact and help the people of various communities to live a better, and hassle-free life.

I am really excited to be a part of this.

I can be reached through any of the following platforms:
