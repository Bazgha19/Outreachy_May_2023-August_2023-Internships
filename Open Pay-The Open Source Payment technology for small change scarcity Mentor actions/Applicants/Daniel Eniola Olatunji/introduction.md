Hello, Good day!

My name is **Daniel Eniola Olatunji**. It is quite the privilege for me to partake in the MboaLabs project, particularly the Open Pay Project; I am excited, as well as elated because of the Cyber Security part that will be part of it.
As a Third year student of the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria; studying Cyber Security Science, this project caught my attention.

I have not had much real life experience when it comes to things Cyber Security, but I have well pertaken in several Cyber Security Hackathons including CySec Hackathon, DefCon, NaijaSecCon, amongst others.
I picked this project to improve my Cyber Security skills and have real life and hand-ons experience, and to use my Cyber Security skills/expertise; no matter how little to contribute to something that will leave a positive impact and help the people of various communities to live a better, and hassle-free life.

I am really excited to be a part of this.
