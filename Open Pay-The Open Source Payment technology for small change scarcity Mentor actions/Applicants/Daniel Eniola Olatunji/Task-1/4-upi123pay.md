## UPI 123pay

This Payment solution is in some way, similar to the project that we, at MboaLab are working on, especially because of "Feature phones(mobile phones with fixed features)", which can be viewed as a miniaturised hardware device that has one specific use.

The National Payments Corporation of India has created their own system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a mobile application wherein users can handle their banking operations and make payments. UPI is a front-running initiative such as the use of Quick-Response(QR) codes for transactions and enabling both peer-to-peer and peer-to-merchant online transfers.

The Reserve Bank of India(RBI) recently launched an interactive IVR(Interactive Voice Response)-based Unified Payment Interface(UPI) service called ‘UPI 123pay’, which can be used even by those who do not have a smartphone or an active internet connection.

Feature phone users can conduct a variety of transactions based on four technological alternatives via UPI 123PAY; calling an IVR(interactive voice response) number, app functionality in feature phones, a missed call-based approach, and proximity sound-based payments.

UPI 123Pay enables offline payments using feature phones; through a call-based system, customers set up their own IDs and create a verifiable PIN that will be used for future offline transactions.

Users of this service simply need to give a missed call to the pre-defined IVR number displayed on the merchant’s counter and need to enter their UPI PIN when asked to. UPI 123Pay is a giant leap forward towards mass inclusion and extension of digital payments in a secure manner to non-smartphone users. It democratises digital banking and removes dependence on the internet. Anyone, even with a simple feature phone, will now get access to digital banking. The proximity sound-based payments feature in the UPI 123Pay app uses high-frequency ultrasound waves for data transfer between mobile phones thus it does not require internet.


### What's UPI?

Unified Payment Interface(UPI), is an application through which users can transfer funds between bank accounts. It was created as a mobile payment system by the National Payments Corporation of India.

When initiating a transaction, customers are no longer required to provide sensitive information such as bank account numbers or other financial information.

UPI was introduced by the RBI to reduce cash-based transactions in India. A large portion of the population who did not own smartphones did not have access to UPI. To address this issue, the RBI launched UPI 123Pay. Customers will be able to use their feature phones for nearly all transactions except scan and pay with UPI 123Pay.


### Drawbacks and Solutions

Offline digital payment may be a crucial development for financial inclusion, but the existing infrastructure has several deficiencies. 

For example, offline payments pose higher security risks. To protect the sensitive information of customers and merchants, offline transactions are limited to small-value payments, such as prepaid cards with very low limits.

A few technologies have been in the works to address this issue; one such technology is a debit card with radio frequency identification(RFI) that can facilitate transactions offline, if in proximity.

Another innovative approach in India is the use of sound-based authentication, where voice is used as biometric data to confirm a user’s credentials. Voice recognition could be an especially useful technology in places like Afghanistan, where women may be unwilling or unable to show their faces for biometric authentication.
