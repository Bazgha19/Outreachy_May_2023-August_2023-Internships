# Limitations in the adoption of Payment Solutions

There has been some limitations in adoption and wide use of Payments Solutions by the local population, especially in the informal sectors, because of certain hassles that come with adopting these Payment Solutions; like Processing fees, Complex Payment Processing Technologies, inability to perform basic daily transactions without having to cash out at the nearest agent and pay associated fees, e.t.c.

Hence, certain measures have to be tailored to curb these issues; that means solutions that provide complete transparency, that are economical, customizable and easy to use — designed to drive growth and provide a community presence.


### Completely transparent

Payment processors would normally list fees and costs on their websites to make it easy for small businesses to select a provider that best meets their needs and budget. Unfortunately, that's not the way most major Payment Processor Organizations do it.

Instead, payment processing fees are just plain confusing and hard to understand. That's a major headache for local business owners who don't have the time or in-house Financial Officers to help them make sense of complex contracts and rapidly changing fees.

This complexity often results in small business owners getting themselves into programs they don't fully understand and bills with surprising payment processing fees that are higher than expected.

The small business market needs payment processing solutions that are easy for small business owners to navigate and understand. And this requires a fair and transparent fee platform that eliminates unpredictable fees and allows small businesses to take control of payment processing.

In other words, a Payment processing solution provider breaks down fees — line by line — and shows a comparison table detailing how fees stack up against the competition.


### Economical and easy to use

Local business owners are looking for cost-effective payment solutions to help drive business forward and make their lives easier. When it comes to payment processing technology, business owners want efficiency at a reasonable cost and don't want to read an encyclopedia on how to use it.

They also don't want to be required to purchase costly point-of-sale (POS) stations which require monthly software subscriptions, and they don't want payment technology with tons of features that they never use even though they are paying for them.

A single, comprehensive provider that can reduce complexity, simplify and consolidate solutions would be a perfect fit for local businesses. We're talking about an integrated payment processing technology to consolidate all payment processing functions under a single platform, making the payment processing experience faster, simpler and more cost-effective.

Equally important are solutions to save small business owners money, allowing them to realize more profit and reinvest in their businesses. A Cash Discount Program (CDP) is a budget-friendly payment processing option allowing owners to pay a low, flat monthly subscription for unlimited credit card processing that eliminates up to 100% of monthly processing fees, pain points of variable fees and inconsistency.


### Drive growth

In today's digital-first environment, it is essential for small businesses to embed payment processing technology into operations to stay relevant and competitive.

This technology, which provides the ability to offer multiple payment acceptance options, including mobile payments to convenience-minded consumers, is vital for every small business. By providing a range of payment options, small business owners are able to attract more customers and significantly increase sales volume.


### Provide a community presence

When it comes to sales and service of payment solutions, most companies don't have boots on the ground in small and rural towns. Instead, Payment solution providers rely on remote sales and support to service local customers. The fact is, these locals need high levels of service and engagement just as much as businesses located in major urban regions.

To better serve businesses in local markets, payment processing providers should build out customer service and sales capabilities by hiring agents in these communities. This allows providers to conduct sales outreach on a personal level to build relationships with local business owners and ensures that a representative is always in proximity, to help with installations and any issues, directly.

Access to resources is vital for small businesses in small towns and rural areas to succeed. Supporting and elevating small businesses with these services and technology helps stimulate local economies and creates needed employment opportunities.

### Face-to-Face Daily Transactions

A key constraint for increasing digital transaction volumes in rural areas, and why many local businesses refuse to adopt these Payment Solutions is because, local business owners who receive payments digitally find it difficult to use electronic money for their daily transactions. To use their hard-earned income, they must often cash out at their nearest agent and pay the associated fees.

This process can be cumbersome and expensive because agents are often far away and do not always have the liquidity to fulfill customers’ cash-in/cash-out requests.

The most common types of face-to-face payment transactions made by these local business owners are frequent (four to five times per day) and involve paying workers and/or purchasing consumer goods like food and beverages at small shops, often individual merchants with no employees.

In solving this issue, the value proposition for smallholders to receive digital payments increases significantly if recipients can make their most common everyday transactions digitally. This means, small-value, face-to-face payments as P2P (Person-to-Person) transfers should be digitized.
