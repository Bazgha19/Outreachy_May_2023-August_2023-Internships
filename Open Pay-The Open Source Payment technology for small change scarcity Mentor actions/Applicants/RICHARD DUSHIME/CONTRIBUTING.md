# Open Pay: The Open Source Payment technology for small change scarcity
Are you passionate about payment solutions and interested in contributing to open source projects? Look no further! We are currently seeking new contributors for our Open Pay project, an open source payment technology aimed at solving the problem of small cash scarcity in many countries.

As a contributor, you will have the opportunity to work on developing an innovative solution that combines the use of a mobile app and miniaturized hardware to transform any smart device into a payment tool. By bridging the gap between trust, inclusion, and technological performance, we aim to make commercial activities more accessible and convenient for everyone.

But we need your help to make this project a reality. If you have experience in software development, cybersecurity, or any related field, we encourage you to join our team. Together, we can work towards creating a solution that will have a positive impact on local economies and businesses.

As an open source project, we welcome contributions from all backgrounds and skill levels. Whether you are an experienced developer or just starting out, your ideas and contributions are valuable to us.
