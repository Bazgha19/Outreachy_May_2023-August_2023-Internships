# Brand Identity 
Looking at other existing solutions and their brand names, we can see some trends and patterns that could inform our decision on the best fit for the Open Pay project.

Many existing solutions in the payment industry have brand names that reflect speed, convenience, and simplicity. For example, PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp all have names that suggest quick and easy payments.

Other solutions emphasize security and trust, such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, which leverage the trust and reputation of established tech companies.
