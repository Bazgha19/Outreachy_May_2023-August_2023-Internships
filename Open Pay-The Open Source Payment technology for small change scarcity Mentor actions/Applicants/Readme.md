Mboalab is an open and collaborative space located in the village of Mefou-Assi, Yaounde, Cameroon. The aim of Mboalab is to catalyse sustainable development and improve people's living conditions through open science. We bring together researchers, scholars, educationists, policy makers and the general public to discuss, conceive and implement projects responding to the health, economic and social needs of the community, such as the coronavirus pandemic. Our approach focuses on the integration of local knowledge by centering the local community especially women.

## Open Pay: The Open Source Payment technology for small change scarcity
The shortage of coins (small change) is today a serious problem in many countries having a detrimental impact on commercial activities: gas stations, bakeries, pharmacies, food markets, no sector is immune from this problem. The situation affects sellers who see their turnover drop considerably because to sell, they must first have the small change to give back to consumers who, in most cases, come with banknotes. The situation is just as difficult for consumers who needs to prepare change in advance or make undesired purshases to buy any item. 

A good number of reasons can explain the occurence of this problem including the increasing number of small Jobs meaning that more small change is needed.

If comercial solution to the problem exist, through smart payment methods and tools, there has been some limitation in the adoption and wide use of these technologies by local population especially in the informal sector where this problem is mostly felt. 

Our project aim to solve the issue of small cash scarcity by bridging the gap between trust, inclusion and technological performance. We want to develop an Open Source technology combining the used of a mobile app, couple with a miniaturised hardware system to transform any smart device (smart phone, tablet etc..) into payment tool.  

## Vision Statement:
Open Pay is an open source payment technology that aims to solve the issue of small cash scarcity by bridging the gap between trust, inclusion and technological performance. The project will develop a mobile app and a miniaturised hardware system that can be used to transform any smart device into a payment tool. This will allow people to make payments without having to carry cash, which will benefit both businesses and consumers.

The project's vision is to create a world where everyone has access to safe, secure, and convenient payment methods. By making it easy for people to make payments without cash, Open Pay can help to reduce poverty, promote financial inclusion, and boost economic growth. 

>**_Our main goal is to solve the problem of small cash scarcity by providing an open-source payment technology that is accessible to everyone._**
